# BRIDGEGOOD

BridgeGood is an organization that mentors aspiring designers in Oakland. They recently received a workspace for students to work in. We will be building a reservation and donation system for that workspace. Web students will focus on two user types: users and admin. You will be given hi-fi wireframes and be expected to ship to spec.

You can find the deployed project at [BRIDGEGOOD.dev](https://bridgegood.dev).

### APIs

#### Okta Authentication API

- Okta is the only approved identity and access management company per the Lambda School Engineering Standards
- Okta is a trusted service that has been in buisness since 2009
- Okta allows developers to build identity controls into applications, website web services and devices

#### Venmo Payment API

- Venmo is a mobile payment service owned by PayPal. Venmo account holders can transfer funds to others via a mobile phone app; both the sender and receiver have to live in the U.S.

## Installation Instructions

- Fork and clone the repo to install it as your own remote.
- Set you environment variables
- run: `npm install` to download all dependencies.
- run: `npm start` to start your local development server.

> When using Okta for authentication, the app will need to run locally on port 3000.

### Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=example
    *  REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER_URI="https://example-882474.okta.com"
    *  REACT_APP_API_URI=http://localhost:3000

### Other Scripts

    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
