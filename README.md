# BRIDGEGOOD

BridgeGood is an organization that mentors aspiring designers in Oakland. They recently received a workspace for students to work in. We will be building a reservation and donation system for that workspace. Web students will focus on two user types: users and admin. You will be given hi-fi wireframes and be expected to ship to spec.

You can find the deployed project at [bridgegood.dev](http://main.d2pjupszhlnsi0.amplifyapp.com/login).

Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## Payment API here

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.
